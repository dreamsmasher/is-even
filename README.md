# is-even

A simple Haskell library to verify whether or not a number is even or not. The complementary function `isOdd` is also exported for your convenience.

## Installation:
```
stack install is-even
```

## Usage:
```
isEven 3
> False

isEven 4
> True

isOdd 0
> False

isOdd 1
> True

```

A glance at the source code will show that this is complete satire. Please don't **ever** use this library in production.
Don't be like the npm folks.

If you have any ideas for even more convoluted implementations, please feel free to submit a pull request. I had a lot of fun working on this.
